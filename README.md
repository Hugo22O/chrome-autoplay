Having trouble enabling Chrome autoplay? Here's a solution

## Introduction

Autoplay is beneficial for some applications. Say, you are on YouTube and click on a video. Chance is very high that you want to play the video so that configuring the site to play videos automatically may make sense.

Google introduced a new flag in Chrome 61 which gives users of the web browser control over the browser's autoplay behavior. However, many user report not being albe to find the autoplay policy. Google has presumably removed this feature from Google Chrome, as many people are unable to find this policy. (photo below)

I found my self not being able to find the autoplay policy by browsing to chrome://flags/#autoplay-policy. Like suggested in multiple online forums. I found all answers out to date and had a hard time finding an answer to my question: *How can I **enable** autoplay so my videos automatically start playing, this is a must for my kiosk application.* 







By default the autoplay policy is set to *User gesture is required -- Users don't need to interact with the document for video or audio sources to start playing automatically.*
